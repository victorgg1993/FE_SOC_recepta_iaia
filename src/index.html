            <h1>Directions</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in</p>
            <p>flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce</p>
            <p>temperature and let simmer.</p>
            <p>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a</p>
            <p>lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so</p>
            <p>that it does not run off.</p>
            <p>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175</p>
            <p>degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p>
